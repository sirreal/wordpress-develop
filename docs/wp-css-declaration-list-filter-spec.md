# CSS Declaration List Filter Specification

Status: implemented on `css-api/safecss-filter-attr` as the default path of
`safecss_filter_attr()` in `wp-includes/kses.php`. Each section states a
decision. The "Decisions" section records the questions that were open during
the prototype and how each was settled.

## Purpose

The declaration list filter replaces the parsing and checking inside
`safecss_filter_attr()`. It takes the decoded CSS text of a `style` attribute,
parses it as a declaration list, drops the declarations a policy rejects, and
returns a declaration list built from the accepted ones.

The legacy function splits on `;`, matches property names as text, and tests
values with regular expressions. The filter parses with
`WP_HTML_Style_Attribute_Processor`, so the unit it accepts or rejects is the
same declaration a browser sees.

## Home

There is no new public function or class. `safecss_filter_attr()` keeps its
signature and docblock. It builds the allowed property list once, applies
`safe_style_css` once, and dispatches to one of two private helpers in
`kses.php`:

- `_safecss_filter_attr_declarations( $css, $allowed_attr )`: this filter.
- `_safecss_filter_attr_legacy( $css, $allowed_attr )`: the pre-7.2.0 body,
  unchanged except that it receives the list.

The declarations helper uses seven further private helpers:
`_safecss_filter_attr_value_has_open_block()`,
`_safecss_filter_attr_value_is_allowed()`, `_safecss_filter_attr_url_is_allowed()`,
`_safecss_filter_attr_ends_inside_token()`, `_safecss_filter_attr_is_trivia()`,
`_safecss_filter_attr_serialize_value()` and
`_safecss_filter_attr_serialize_hash_value()`. All are `@access private`,
`@internal`, `@since 7.2.0`.

## Scope

In scope: a declaration list, as in a `style` attribute or the body of one
rule. Out of scope: whole stylesheets, at-rules, selectors, and `@font-face`
descriptors. Those need their own parsing and their own policy.

The filter does not decode HTML entities and does not encode its output. CSS
source text goes in and CSS source text comes out. Entity handling belongs to
the HTML layer, as it does for the legacy function's KSES caller.

The filter does not call `wp_kses_no_null()`. The legacy function did, which
deleted NUL bytes and every `\0`-prefixed text run before parsing. The
processor handles NUL bytes as CSS does (U+FFFD), and deleting `\0` text would
corrupt valid escapes such as `\00e9`. A `\0` escape therefore decodes to
U+FFFD, as it does in a browser.

## Parsing Model

The filter sees only what the processor exposes as a declaration. Text the
processor skips is never checked and never emitted. This includes items with no
colon, at-rules, and declarations whose value contains a bad string, a bad URL,
an unmatched closing token, a top-level `!`, or a `{}` block mixed with other
tokens in a non-custom property. The processor's specification, "Invalid
Fragments", defines this and the splitting rule for a stray `}`.

Consequence: the filter never has to judge malformed CSS. A declaration either
parses as CSS or is not there.

## Value Access

The filter reads each value through
`WP_HTML_Style_Attribute_Processor::get_value_tokens()`, the token view the
processor exposes: the slice of its own token list covering the value, each
token as `{type, value, start, length, end}` with offsets into the style text.
The filter uses the decoded `value` and `unit` for the checks and for
re-escaping strings, URLs, identifiers, function names, hashes, at-keywords and
dimensions, and copies numbers, percentages, delimiters and punctuation from
the source bytes at `start` and `length`. The input is tokenized a second time, with
`WP_CSS_Token_Processor`, only to read `is_token_terminated()` on its last
token for rule 0.

## Rejection Unit

One declaration. A rejected declaration is dropped whole. No declaration is
rewritten to make it acceptable, and no declaration is rejected because of a
neighbour.

## Policy

One rule applies to every declaration, for every property including custom
ones:

0. **Open blocks and tokens cut off by the end of the input.** A value with
   a block (a function, `(`, `[` or `{`) still open at the end of the input
   is rejected. When the input ends inside a comment, string or url token,
   the last accepted declaration is dropped: such a token runs to the end of
   the input, so it is in the last declaration or after it (`color: red; /*`
   gives an empty result). The legacy function rejected an unbalanced
   parenthesis and a `/*` comment, and callers rely on a rejected
   declaration staying rejected. CSS would close the block or token at the
   end of the input, so the processor exposes the declaration; the filter
   drops it. The tokenizer reports the cut-off token through
   `is_token_terminated()`.

An empty `safe_style_css` list disables filtering. `safecss_filter_attr()`
returns the input with NUL bytes and newlines removed, which is what the
legacy function returns for an empty list, and does not call the declarations
helper. A filter result that is not an array is treated as an empty list.

1. **Property name.** The decoded, lowercased name is in the `safe_style_css`
   list, whose entries are lowercased once before matching; or the list
   contains `--*` and the name matches `^--[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`. Custom property
   names are matched case-sensitively.
2. **Functions.** Every function in the value, at any nesting depth, is in the
   function allowlist: the legacy function's list, the six gradient functions,
   and the color functions `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab`, `lch`,
   `oklab`, `oklch`, `color`, `color-mix`, `light-dark`. Names are decoded and
   matched case-insensitively. There is no per-property list: a gradient or a
   color function is allowed on every property.
3. **URLs.** Every URL in the value, at any depth, whether a `url()` token or
   `url("...")` with a string argument, is non-empty after trimming and is
   returned unchanged by `wp_kses_bad_protocol()` with `wp_allowed_protocols()`.
   `url()` with anything other than one string argument is invalid CSS and the
   declaration is dropped. `src()` is treated like `url()`. There is no
   per-property list of URL-bearing properties.
4. **Structure.** In a non-custom property, the value has no bare `( )` block
   and no `{ }` block at its top level. No standard property grammar accepts
   either. A `[ ]` block is kept: `grid-template-columns: [a] 1fr` is valid.
   A `( )` block nested in a function, as in `calc(1px + (2px * 3))` or a
   `var()` fallback, is governed by that function's grammar and is kept.
   Custom properties keep every block.
5. **Delimiters.** The value has no `&`, `<`, `>` or `=` delimiter token and
   no `<!--` or `-->` token at any depth, in every property including custom
   ones. These characters have a meaning in HTML. Inside strings and URLs the
   serializer escapes them; outside strings and URLs no standard property
   value uses them, so a value that has them is rejected.
6. **Escapes and comments.** Checks run on decoded values, so an escaped
   function name or scheme is checked as what it denotes. Comments are never
   emitted.

Beyond rules 4 and 5 the policy checks what a value contains, not whether it
is valid for its property. Browser grammar is out of scope.

## Output

The output is built from the accepted declarations, not cut from the input.
Each declaration is `property:value;` with `!important` preserved as
` !important` before the `;`. Property names are the decoded names. Values are
serialized from their tokens: strings and URLs re-escaped from their decoded
values with `WP_CSS_Token_Processor::serialize_string()`; identifiers,
function names, at-keywords and dimension units re-escaped with
`serialize_ident()`; hash names re-escaped with every code point outside
`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` and U+0080 and above hex-escaped, so `#fff` and `#123456` are
unchanged; a dimension's number copied from the source; numbers, percentages,
delimiters and punctuation copied from the source; whitespace and comment runs
reduced to one space. A token copied from the source could end in a hex
escape and merge with the token after a dropped comment; re-escaping from the
decoded value puts a space after every escape, so `#a\62/**/c` serializes as
`#ab c`. No block is open at the end of a value, by rule 0, so
the output never absorbs the `;` that follows. A `\` delimiter, which
only a backslash before a newline produces, keeps its newline so it does not
escape the space that follows.

`serialize_string()` hex-escapes `\`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `,`, `;`, `{`, `}` and
both quotes. A URL with a query string therefore serializes as
`url("a?x=1\26 y=2")`, which decodes to the same URL.

Properties of the output:

- It re-parses to the accepted declarations and nothing else.
- Filtering it again changes nothing.
- It ends with `;` when non-empty. Callers that tested for `;` to detect
  multiple declarations, or that appended their own `;`, must accept both
  forms while the legacy path exists. See "Callers".

## Callers

Core-owned callers adapted on this branch. Each accepts the legacy form (no
trailing `;`) and the new form (trailing `;`):

- `WP_Style_Engine_CSS_Declarations::filter_declaration()` strips one trailing
  `;` from the filtered declaration, restores the spacer after the colon when
  prettifying, and then appends ` !important` when the result has no `;`.
  `get_declarations_string()` appends `;` as before. The engine's output bytes
  are unchanged except for the filter's value serialization (double-quoted
  strings in `url()`).
- `get_block_wrapper_attributes()` strips one trailing `;` from the merged
  `style` value, as it strips `;` from its inputs.
- `wp_get_layout_style()` filtered a bare value such as `800px`, which the
  legacy function passed through and this filter drops as an item with no
  colon. It now filters `max-width:` plus the value and keeps the value of the
  result.
- `WP_Theme_JSON::is_safe_css_declaration()` tests for a non-empty result and
  needs no change.

Files under `wp-includes/blocks/` are synced from the Gutenberg repository and
are not changed here. `post-featured-image.php` appends `;` after each
filtered declaration, which now gives `;;`: an empty declaration, which
browsers ignore. The other block callers put the result in a `style`
attribute, where a trailing `;` changes nothing. A Gutenberg change can drop
the appended `;`.

## Hooks

`safe_style_css` is honoured as today, applied once before dispatch, so both
paths see the same list. An empty list, or a result that is not an array,
returns the input before dispatch (see "Policy").

`safecss_filter_attr_use_legacy` is new in 7.2.0. It receives `false` and the
input CSS; returning `true` selects the legacy helper. It exists for a
transition period so a site can restore the previous output while it adapts.

`safecss_filter_attr_allow_css` is deprecated in 7.2.0 and applied by the
legacy helper only. It exposed a regex test string that has no equivalent
here. When a callback is attached, the declarations helper calls
`_deprecated_hook()` once per call, naming `safe_style_css` as the
replacement, and does not apply the hook. A site that needs the hook can
select the legacy helper through `safecss_filter_attr_use_legacy`.

## Differences From The Legacy Function

Intended:

- Property names match case-insensitively.
- Color functions, gradients and `url()` are allowed on every property.
- Functions may nest to any depth.
- A function not on the allowlist is rejected wherever it appears, including
  inside a gradient.
- A declaration CSS would drop is dropped, even when the legacy function kept
  its text. This includes an item with no colon, which the legacy function
  passed through unchecked.
- Escapes are accepted, decoded for the checks, and re-escaped in the output.
- A `\0` escape decodes to U+FFFD instead of being deleted from the text.
- A `<` or `>` delimiter and a `<!--` or `-->` token are rejected. The legacy
  function rejected `&` and `=` and kept `<` and `>`.
- A string or url token cut off by the end of the input drops the last
  declaration, in every property. The legacy function kept an unclosed
  string and an unclosed `url(` with no `(` in its test string.
- A lone `{ }` block in a standard property is rejected, as the legacy
  function rejected `}`.
- An allowed-list entry with capitals matches, since entries and names are
  lowercased before matching.
- `safecss_filter_attr_allow_css` is deprecated and not applied.

Formatting only: no space after the colon, double-quoted strings with
hex-escaped punctuation, URLs as `url("...")`, trailing `;`.

Unchanged: a block left open at the end of the input is rejected, as the
legacy function rejected an unbalanced parenthesis; a comment left open at
the end of the input drops the declaration, as the legacy function rejected
`/*`; an empty `safe_style_css` list returns the input.

On the 156 legacy test vectors: 31 identical, 115 formatting only, 2
narrowings (`expression()` inside a gradient; an unmatched `)`), 8 widenings,
0 defects, idempotent on all 156.

## Decisions

Open during the prototype, now settled:

- **Open blocks.** Rejected for every property. The prototype closed them in
  the output, which
  accepted nine inputs the legacy function rejected; callers rely on a
  rejected declaration staying rejected. With the rule, the serializer has no
  block-closing code.
- **Bare `( )` and `{ }` blocks.** Rejected at the top level of a non-custom
  property's value; kept when nested in a function and in custom properties.
  Rejecting at any depth would drop `calc(3em + (10px * 2))`, which the legacy
  function accepts and which is valid CSS. The processor already drops a
  `{ }` block mixed with other tokens in a non-custom property; this rule
  covers a value that is only a `{ }` block.
- **Tokens cut off by the end of the input.** A comment, string or url token
  the input ends inside drops the last accepted declaration, for every
  property including custom ones. An earlier version rejected only strings,
  only in non-custom properties, and detected them from the token's source
  bytes. The tokenizer now reports the condition through
  `is_token_terminated()`, and the rule covers comments and url tokens, which
  have the same shape: the token runs to the end of the input, and a
  consumer that emits the original text would have the rest of its
  stylesheet read as part of the token.
- **Transition.** The filter is named `safecss_filter_attr_use_legacy`,
  defaults to `false`, and receives the input CSS. Duration is not fixed; the
  filter docblock says it exists for a transition period.
- **Shared property list.** `safecss_filter_attr()` builds the list once and
  passes it to both helpers. The prototype's copy is deleted.
- **Value access.** The token view, as bare arrays, as PR 2 ships it. The
  prototype's `get_value_source()` is not kept.
- **`wp_kses_no_null()`.** Not applied on the new path. See "Scope".

## Tests

`tests/phpunit/tests/kses/safecssFilterAttr.php` covers each policy rule in
isolation, the open-block rule in standard and custom properties, the
cut-off token rule for comments, strings and url tokens, the structural rule in standard, nested and custom positions,
`!important`, comments, whitespace, escapes, the empty `safe_style_css` list,
the two filters, and idempotence over a provider of the inputs that exercise
the serializer.

`tests/phpunit/tests/kses.php` keeps every legacy input. `data_safecss_filter_attr`
and `data_kses_style_attr_with_url` assert the new output; their `_legacy`
copies assert the pre-7.2.0 output through `safecss_filter_attr_use_legacy`.
`tools/Tests_Safecss_Filter_Differential.php` compares the two paths over both
providers and classifies each difference.

Tests outside kses changed for the value serialization only: single-quoted
`url('...')` becomes `url("...")` in `tests/phpunit/tests/style-engine/styleEngine.php`
and `tests/phpunit/tests/block-supports/wpRenderBackgroundSupport.php`, and
`margin-top: 2px` becomes `margin-top:2px` in `tests/phpunit/tests/blocks/supportedStyles.php`,
and `style` attributes filtered through `wp_kses()` take the `prop:value;` form in
`tests/phpunit/tests/icons/wpIconsRegistry.php` and `tests/phpunit/tests/post/output.php`.
One Style Engine test asserted legacy policy: that `safecss_filter_attr_allow_css`
fires and that `url()` is dropped on `line-height`. It now asserts the new
output.
